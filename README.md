# Bhala-Tutor-Personal
Bhala-Smart is an Ollama-powered tutor built for South African Grade 12 learners. Unlike generic AI, it acts like a strict CAPS teacher—rooting out informal slang (like "eish" or "bra") and fixing comma splices without rewriting the essay for you. It’s local, private, and designed to help students actually learn to write better.
